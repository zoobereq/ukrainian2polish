## ukrainian2polish

The program takes a string representing a Ukrainian anthroponym (first and/or last name) and outputs its Polish transcription.
The transcription is generated based on the guidelines supplied by the Polish Scientific Publishers (PWN), which can be accessed [here](https://sjp.pwn.pl/zasady/Transliteracja-i-transkrypcja-wspolczesnego-alfabetu-ukrainskiego;629710.html).
The program assumes standard name capitalization, where only the first letters of the fist name and the surname are capitalized.  It will also work on all lowercase strings.  The user can input one name at at time or multiple names separated by commas.
