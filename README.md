## ukrainian2polish

The program takes a string representing first and/or last name in starndard Ukrainian and outputs its Polish transcription.
The transcription is generated based on the guidelines supplied by the Polish Scientific Publishers (PWN), which can be accessed [here](https://sjp.pwn.pl/zasady/Transliteracja-i-transkrypcja-wspolczesnego-alfabetu-ukrainskiego;629710.html).
The program assumes starndard name capitalization, where the first letter of the fist name and the surname is capitalized.
It will also work on all lowercase strings.  The user can input one name at at time, or multiple names separated by commas.
